# Implementation of `samples/lec21.tex`

## Overview
This repository provides a practical implementation of the core algorithms described in `samples/lec21.tex`. It offers a functional codebase to apply the paper's methods for solving specific computational problems, focusing on iterative numerical solutions.

## Implemented Algorithms
- Newton's Method: An iterative algorithm for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.

## Repository Structure
- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the implemented algorithms.
- `tests/`: Includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementations.
