# Paper-to-Production AI Engineer

An AI system that reads ML research papers and converts them into
production-ready, testable code.

## Problem
Most research never reaches production due to translation complexity.

## Solution
We build an AI pipeline that:
1. Parses research papers
2. Extracts algorithms
3. Generates clean, modular code
4. Adds tests & benchmarks

## Demo
- Input: Research paper PDF
- Output: Working Python module + tests

## Current Status
- MVP supports algorithmic ML papers
- Focused on reproducibility & performance

## Roadmap
- Multi-paper reasoning
- Hardware-aware optimization
- Enterprise integration
